# Hi ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Github! 


My name is Pedro, I live in Belo Horizonte - Brazil and I'm a Fullstack Web Development student @ Trybe.

:books: Over the last few months, I have been learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and Javascript for Web Development. I also studied the basics of some frontend stacks such as React and Redux.

:rocket: Iâ€™m currently learning backend abilities such as Node.js with Express, Typescript and Sequelize, as well as the basics of the OOP paradigm.

Here are the stacks I'm already comfortable using
